# A-Vocabulary.com-Vocab-List-TO-Anki-Deck-Converter

#What is this?

This is a a console program which i wrote in python. It can automatically create deck based on any list in vocabulary.com. I made this with the purpose to use it with the vocabgarbber in vocabulary.com. It's a powerful feature that grabs hard vocab from whatever text you enter. I use it to learn every word i dont know before i read something hard and i found it works pretty good for me in terms of increasing the amount i read and retaining the vocab in my head.

#How to use it

1. You need to login to a vocabulary.com account (free to sign up)
2. (OPTIONAL) Grab vocab using the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/lists/vocabgrabber">vocabgarbber</a> and click create list
3. Open the list that you want to add to anki (make sure it's the actual page that shows the list, here's what i mean)
